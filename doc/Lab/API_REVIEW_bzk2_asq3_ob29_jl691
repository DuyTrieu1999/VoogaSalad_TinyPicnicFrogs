### Different Teams (Authoring Frontend)
* Yeet
    * API Design
        * RenderSystem - creates visual controls (i.e. buttons, sliders, panes)
        * Editor - calls public methods from RenderSystem
            * MapEditor
            * CharacterEditor
            * GameEditor
* Tiny Picnic Frogs
    * API Design
        * ActorMenu - allows user to access the different actors they have created
        * GameMap - lets user place an actor in the actual overworld

### Part 1
> What about your API/design is intended to be flexible?
* RenderSystem is able to be used by any system or editor. To add to the existing elements create new methods.

> How is your API/design encapsulating your implementation decisions?
* Game player has access to the RenderSystem and can use the UI elements defined in the API. 

> How is your part linked to other parts of the project?
* The front end of the game authoring environment passes the user's game design into the backend of the game authoring environment so that it can compile it into a format that the game player can run the game.

> What exceptions (error cases) might occur in your part and how will you handle them (or not, by throwing)?
* Invalid inputs or selections
    * throw an invalid exception (through an alert box)

> Why do you think your API/design is good (also define what your measure of good is)?
* Relatively extendable - have the ability to add new controls and editors
    * good, because follows the open closed principle

### Part 2
> Discuss the use cases/issues that you are responsible for: are they descriptive, appropriate, reasonably sized?
* Create a GUI
* Allow users to load a map
* Allow users to add actors
* Allow users to add actors to spots on the map

> Estimate how long you think each will take and why. What, if anything, makes estimating these tasks uncertain?
* Create a GUI
    * 1 day
* Allow users to load a map
    * Half a day
* Allow users to add actors
    * Half a day
* Allow users to add actors to spots on the map
    * 1 day

> What feature/design problem are you most excited to work on?
* Being able to click and add actors to a map

> What feature/design problem are you most worried about working on?
* Connecting the front end of the authoring environment to the back end of the authoring environment
* user defined hit boxes for each frame for each character an saving/loading this data in the game authoring and game player

> What major feature do you plan to implement this weekend?
* Being able to add and customize actors to the map
