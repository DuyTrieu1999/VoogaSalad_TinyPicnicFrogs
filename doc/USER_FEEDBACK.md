- Was able to place actors intuitively
- Selecting animations is kind of arduous 
- "Interactions" is not intuitively named
- When connecting maps, when you click the portal point it should mark it
- sorting background elements
- shift click to fill background with multiple tiles
- when you click fullscreen it should stretch
- very large maps break
- Clicking new map and then cancel breaks the authoring environment
- Drag and create a square that will create an square filled with selected background
- Connecting very large maps breaks
- Connect map allows you to pick more than one square when it shouldn't
- Map size cannot handle negative values or throw an error
- New prototype form can highlight incorrectly filled or broken fields
- Light and dark theme are missing
